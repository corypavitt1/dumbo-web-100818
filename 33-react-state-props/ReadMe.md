- How to be Successful
  - Pull down lecture notes
    - Will be partner/code-along challenges during lectures when it makes sense
  - Review lecture videos
    - We will not have 1:1s to reteach something that was already taught in lecture
  - If you're struggling with a concept, great, if you cant figure out why something isn't working use labs & lecture videos first
  - Practice, practice, practice
  - Stay organized
